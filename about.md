I am currently finishing my PhD ([University of Strasbourg](http://www.unistra.fr/index.php?id=english), France and [University of Münster](www.uni-muenster.de/en/), Germany) on "The habitation quarter of Bogazköy-Hattusa" while also working part time as IT-responsible at the [Istanbul Branch](http://www.dainst.org/standort/-/organization-display/ZI9STUj61zKB/14478?p_r_p_1690909578_redirectURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dainst.org%2Fstandorte-suchen) of the [German Archaeological Institute](http://www.dainst.org/). I am particularly interested in developing theory and methods for exploring archeological data and making reproducible and transparent research. During my Phd, it became clear to me that transparent and reproductible research were extremely important for the futur of archeology. Most of my work is written with [R](www.r-project.org/) using [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to via mail [ask me](mailto:nehemie.strupler@etu.unistra.fr).

Thanks for reading!
