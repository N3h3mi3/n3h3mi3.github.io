This my first post online. There is no other purpose than to test how it works. Much thanks to the post of [Joshua Lande](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) using [poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), which i just forked. I will use this site as a open sandbox to learn how to hava a nice, open, reproducible an easy to maintain microblogging site. 

## But Why?
For one year I am following [R-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/) and learn a lot from all the ideas. After reading the book [Opening Science](http://book.openingscience.org/) I decided to try. 

I hope I will use this blog for :

  - Explain on-going thinking for my PhD
  - Use it to share some thought on diverse lectures
  - Link and publish some of my data
  - Learn doing transparent research
