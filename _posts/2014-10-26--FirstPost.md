This my first post. I dit it ;-). For this post there is no other purpose than to test how it works. Much thanks to [Joshua Lande](http://joshualande.com/) and [his repository](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) using [poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), which i just forked. I will use this site as a open sandbox to learn how to have an open, reproducible, easy to use and to maintain microblogging site. 

### Why?
For one year I am following [R-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/) and I love learning from all the ideas aggregatedfrom all the blogs. After reading the book [Opening Science](http://book.openingscience.org/), I decided to give a try. 

I hope I will use this blog for :

  - Explain on-going thinking about my PhD
  - Share ideas and papers for my *reading group* with [Toby C. Wilkinson](http://tobywilkinson.co.uk/)
  - Link and publish some of my data
  - Learning by doing transparent research
